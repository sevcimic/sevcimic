- 👋 Hi, I’m Michal Ševčík (@sevcimic) and I am using this as my private code depository.
- 👀 I’m interested in React, Vue and .Net Core.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning React and Vue, because I am primary backend developer, but those frameworks looks interesting.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on something, if you want.
